### The State of the Industry
When talking about the state of fullstack development, the most important thing to talk about is the rate of change of the industry.  
For those currently in formal education like myself, any textbooks that I may learn from are almost assuredly out of date by the  
time they are published. However, this is not a problem that is isolated to students. Every year there is a new "best way" to do  
things in the industry. A new language, a new stack, a new platform, etc. Every fullstack developer has to be a good dev, and an  
even better student. While this is true about most fields of study, web development has been exploding over the last few years  
and shows no sign of stopping. 
  
  
### Newcomers
While fullstack development may be hard to keep up with, there are programs and frameworks that allow more people to easily  
access website making tools for beginners. There are super entry level GUI-based websites like Wix that allow you to make  
easy template sites. There are also slightly more advanced ones like Wordpress. Wordpress is revolutionary for all front-end  
developers as a tool that can be as simple or as advanced and customizable as a user wants. For those who are just barely  
entry level coders, there are many places out there to grab templates of code sold by individuals or just put on the  
internet for free. This code sharing blurs the line between grabbing bits and pieces to make your own thing, or straight  
up plagarism. It is an unfortunate reality, but this is not an issue that can be easily solved, and will continue for the  
time being.
  

### Websites vs Web-Apps
One thing mentioned in *The Fullstack Developer* was the shift from websites to webapps. While websites used to be almost  
entirely content-based, these days there are more and more frameworks attached to websites for increased functionalty for  
the user. Chris Coyier explains current web development as if you're creating a russian nesting doll. A bunch of pieces  
all placed inside of one another to get the desired effect, look, and functionality. A website is just a piece of the  
project.
  

### The Shift to Mobile
Every year, a larger and larger percentage of internet users are on their phones. I don't know the exact percentage, but  
I bet that it is well over 50-60% worldwide. All websites made these days are either made as mobile-only/mobile-focused,  
or the developers just make an app. A few years ago, there was a massive push to turn many projects into mobile apps.  
Today the pendulum is swinging the opposite direction with app stores being added to modern operating systems. 
  

### But What Does This Mean???
To be honest, I don't know. Nobody knows what the future of web development holds. Things are moving so rapidly that  
there is no way to predict the future. All we can do is absorb as much information as possible and ride along with  
the rest of the community.

### UX: Functionality vs Eye Candy
While many people thing that the best user experience comes from how good a website looks, that is only one small part of it.  
A lot of website design comes from the formatting and navigational features. If a website is very basic, but is flawless with  
its functionality, it will be viewed as better in comparison to a website that may function poorly, but looks nice. One example  
of this that I have noticed, is hiding menu features to make the home screen more minimalistic. A good example of a high functioning  
website that was referenced in the reading is Craigslist. The site is not very visually stunning, but everything is sorted and  
categorized in a way that immediately makes sense to anyone looking at it. On the other side of the spectrum is the new Clarkson  
myCU page. Personally, I like the way it looks and for simple things it functions fairly well. However, there are sections that  
do not work so well. Sometimes myCU launches you to the old website and it is not clear how to get to the updated one. Certain  
functions are locked in the old version which can be found using the *myCU Homepage* button in the sidebar. But, the website with  
the *myCU* logo is called the *Campus Experience Dashboard*. One example of an odd layout choice for myCU is the exam schedule.  
The exam schedule can only be viewed (to my knowledge) from the *Acedemics* tab in the *Dashboard* section. The *Acedemic* section  
on the sidebar does not lead to the exam schedule in any intuitive way.  
  
### Scalability
Having a system of microservices rather than a monolith model for a web-app can help immensely with the growing pains of a  
company. Both models are better at different things, so it depends on the project. For a small project that needs to get off the  
ground and have little overhead, having all of the code and data in one place makes sense. Once that project scales up, it makes  
sense for the services to be split up amongst many smaller services. For example, when working on the style of a website, you can  
either put the CSS and JavaScript code directly into the HTML page, or split it up amongst different files. Once a project gets to  
be larger than one page, it makes sense for the script files and style files to be kept seperately. For our Random Quotes project,  
I placed all of the arrays used for the randomization and the randomization code in one *script.js* file. If there were going to  
be more aspects to the site, I would have put all of the arrays in their own file.  
  
### The Shift to Mobile II: Advancement
Like I mentioned in my last blog post, having a "mobile first" state of mind makes sense based on the marketshare and the user base  
of websites today. However, another side to the "mobile first" coin is the lack of hardware. Up until 2019/2020, phones were the  
least powerful devices in terms of raw hardware and processing power. Mobile first development makes sense because if a phone cannot  
handle it, then a large portion of your user base is blocked out. Nowadays, smartphones that are being released have processors similar   
to laptops, with more RAM than ever before. For example, the newest iPhone (13 Pro Max) has 6GB of RAM. Many of the newest Android  
phones coming out have anywhere from 6GB to 12GB of RAM. Many laptops being sold today have 8GB of RAM in a base model, so phones are  
not very far behind from modern machines. As a reponse to all this, most websites have dropdown menus or larger buttons on their   
websites. Everything has been optimized for touch screen interaction. As *The Full Stack Developer* mentions, the action of  
hovering with the mouse has been used for menus for so long, but now that entire way of thinking has to be changed as there is no  
hover option for mobile devices (yet).

### Search Engine Optimization
Search Engine Optimization (*SEO*) is one of the most interesting concepts to me as a whole. The entire world of SEO is about who  
can produce results or say the right thing the fastest. Again, mobile first development is important here because not having a   
mobile-friendly website can make your website not show up in Google as high as it would on desktop. This idea of essentially  
tricking Google into using your website for results in order to get more clicks has changed more than just the web dev industry.  
I would bet that many news sites push out new articles as soon as they can after some event in order to be the first result on Google.  
When something happens, the first thing people do is Google it, so if you can push out some fluff content piece about it the fastest,   
your article will be the go-to article, get clicks, then stay on top of Google as other outlets post a similar story. Whatever their  
content is doesn't matter because your article is higher on the screen. People can connected this into ***higher result = more trustworthy***  
The percentage of people who even go to the second page of Google is just over 10%.

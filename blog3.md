### Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
Testing is one of, if not the most important part of any development. I is extremely rare and impressive for someone to  
create an entire program or website, compile it, run it, and have every aspect work on the first try. It just isn't  
realistic. Many times, there are edge cases that fall outside of the bounds of the program, therefore breaking it.  
Test-driven development (TDD) flips this on its head by creating the tests first, then writing a program around it. In my  
opinion, this would only make sense for creating many modules that are mostly completely seperated. Specifically,  
if a program has very specific parameters would be best for this. That being said, there are many upsides to TDD.  
All of the written code is more modular than a standard program might be. This allows for the developer to more  
easily maintain and update the code without breaking multiple modules at once. TDD also prevents bloat in programs.  
The only code that is written is the code needed to pass the tests.  
  
### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)  
When working with clients in the real world, behavior-driven development (BDD) is very important to the success of a  
product. Without someone representing the client during the creation process, the developers and testers are left to  
guess what it is the client really wants. I know from experience that requirements documents can drastically change once  
a project gets to the execution phase. Some things can't be done, some need changes, and sometimes the customer wants  
to change an aspect after the fact, but won't tell you until delivery (Thanks Mark). *The Fullstack Developer* makes a  
good point in the section about the "Three Amigos." It is equally important to have someone representing the customer  
as it is to give everyone an equal voice in the matter. This will lead to the best design and functionality overall.  
If everyone isn't on the same page during the development process, there wil be mistakes and time will be wasted.  
  
### Modern JavaScript  
JavaScript is one of the most used languages for websites and still is to this day. JavaScript was mostly used for  
front-end development until somewhat recently due to the lack of modularity and having to "double-implement" functions  
for a server and a client. This was helped immensely by NodeJS among other environments. This allowed modules to be  
seperate and not clog up the global namespace. The change from JavaScript just being a front-end website language to  
being a fully fleshed out package manager with modules and transpilers did not take much time. Many developers still  
struggle to keep up since everything changes so quickly. With NodeJS, React, Vue, Angular, and others, JavaScript is  
still a powerhouse of a language.

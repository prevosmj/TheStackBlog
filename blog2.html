Candy</h3>
<p>While many people thing that the best user experience comes from how
good a website looks, that is only one small part of it.<br />
A lot of website design comes from the formatting and navigational
features. If a website is very basic, but is flawless with<br />
its functionality, it will be viewed as better in comparison to a
website that may function poorly, but looks nice. One example<br />
of this that I have noticed, is hiding menu features to make the home
screen more minimalistic. A good example of a high functioning<br />
website that was referenced in the reading is Craigslist. The site is
not very visually stunning, but everything is sorted and<br />
categorized in a way that immediately makes sense to anyone looking at
it. On the other side of the spectrum is the new Clarkson<br />
myCU page. Personally, I like the way it looks and for simple things it
functions fairly well. However, there are sections that<br />
do not work so well. Sometimes myCU launches you to the old website and
it is not clear how to get to the updated one. Certain<br />
functions are locked in the old version which can be found using the
<em>myCU Homepage</em> button in the sidebar. But, the website
with<br />
the <em>myCU</em> logo is called the <em>Campus Experience
Dashboard</em>. One example of an odd layout choice for myCU is the exam
schedule.<br />
The exam schedule can only be viewed (to my knowledge) from the
<em>Acedemics</em> tab in the <em>Dashboard</em> section. The
<em>Acedemic</em> section<br />
on the sidebar does not lead to the exam schedule in any intuitive
way.</p>
<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
<p>Having a system of microservices rather than a monolith model for a
web-app can help immensely with the growing pains of a<br />
company. Both models are better at different things, so it depends on
the project. For a small project that needs to get off the<br />
ground and have little overhead, having all of the code and data in one
place makes sense. Once that project scales up, it makes<br />
sense for the services to be split up amongst many smaller services. For
example, when working on the style of a website, you can<br />
either put the CSS and JavaScript code directly into the HTML page, or
split it up amongst different files. Once a project gets to<br />
be larger than one page, it makes sense for the script files and style
files to be kept seperately. For our Random Quotes project,<br />
I placed all of the arrays used for the randomization and the
randomization code in one <em>script.js</em> file. If there were going
to<br />
be more aspects to the site, I would have put all of the arrays in their
own file.</p>
<h3 id="the-shift-to-mobile-ii-advancement">The Shift to Mobile II:
Advancement</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned in my last blog post, having a “mobile first” state
of mind makes sense based on the marketshare and the user base<br />
of websites today. However, another side to the “mobile first” coin is
the lack of hardware. Up until 2019/2020, phones were the<br />
least powerful devices in terms of raw hardware and processing power.
Mobile first development makes sense because if a phone cannot<br />
handle it, then a large portion of your user base is blocked out.
Nowadays, smartphones that are being released have processors
similar<br />
to laptops, with more RAM than ever before. For example, the newest
iPhone (13 Pro Max) has 6GB of RAM. Many of the newest Android<br />
phones coming out have anywhere from 6GB to 12GB of RAM. Many laptops
being sold today have 8GB of RAM in a base model, so phones are<br />
not very far behind from modern machines. As a reponse to all this, most
websites have dropdown menus or larger buttons on their<br />
websites. Everything has been optimized for touch screen interaction. As
<em>The Full Stack Developer</em> mentions, the action of<br />
hovering with the mouse has been used for menus for so long, but now
that entire way of thinking has to be changed as there is no<br />
hover option for mobile devices (yet).</p>
<h3 id="search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>Search Engine Optimization (<em>SEO</em>) is one of the most
interesting concepts to me as a whole. The entire world of SEO is about
who<br />
can produce results or say the right thing the fastest. Again, mobile
first development is important here because not having a<br />
mobile-friendly website can make your website not show up in Google as
high as it would on desktop. This idea of essentially<br />
tricking Google into using your website for results in order to get more
clicks has changed more than just the web dev industry.<br />
I would bet that many news sites push out new articles as soon as they
can after some event in order to be the first result on Google.<br />
When something happens, the first thing people do is Google it, so if
you can push out some fluff content piece about it the fastest,<br />
your article will be the go-to article, get clicks, then stay on top of
Google as other outlets post a similar story. Whatever their<br />
content is doesn’t matter because your article is higher on the screen.
People can connected this into <strong><em>higher result = more
trustworthy</em></strong><br />
The percentage of people who even go to the second page of Google is
just over 10%.</p>

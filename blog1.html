<p>When talking about the state of fullstack development, the most
important thing to talk about is the rate of change of the
industry.<br />
For those currently in formal education like myself, any textbooks that
I may learn from are almost assuredly out of date by the<br />
time they are published. However, this is not a problem that is isolated
to students. Every year there is a new “best way” to do<br />
things in the industry. A new language, a new stack, a new platform,
etc. Every fullstack developer has to be a good dev, and an<br />
even better student. While this is true about most fields of study, web
development has been exploding over the last few years<br />
and shows no sign of stopping.</p>
<h3 id="newcomers">Newcomers</h3>
<p>While fullstack development may be hard to keep up with, there are
programs and frameworks that allow more people to easily<br />
access website making tools for beginners. There are super entry level
GUI-based websites like Wix that allow you to make<br />
easy template sites. There are also slightly more advanced ones like
Wordpress. Wordpress is revolutionary for all front-end<br />
developers as a tool that can be as simple or as advanced and
customizable as a user wants. For those who are just barely<br />
entry level coders, there are many places out there to grab templates of
code sold by individuals or just put on the<br />
internet for free. This code sharing blurs the line between grabbing
bits and pieces to make your own thing, or straight<br />
up plagarism. It is an unfortunate reality, but this is not an issue
that can be easily solved, and will continue for the<br />
time being.</p>
<h3 id="websites-vs-web-apps">Websites vs Web-Apps</h3>
<p>One thing mentioned in <em>The Fullstack Developer</em> was the shift
from websites to webapps. While websites used to be almost<br />
entirely content-based, these days there are more and more frameworks
attached to websites for increased functionalty for<br />
the user. Chris Coyier explains current web development as if you’re
creating a russian nesting doll. A bunch of pieces<br />
all placed inside of one another to get the desired effect, look, and
functionality. A website is just a piece of the<br />
project.</p>
<h3 id="the-shift-to-mobile">The Shift to Mobile</h3>
<p>Every year, a larger and larger percentage of internet users are on
their phones. I don’t know the exact percentage, but<br />
I bet that it is well over 50-60% worldwide. All websites made these
days are either made as mobile-only/mobile-focused,<br />
or the developers just make an app. A few years ago, there was a massive
push to turn many projects into mobile apps.<br />
Today the pendulum is swinging the opposite direction with app stores
being added to modern operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-does-this-mean">But What Does This Mean???</h3>
<p>To be honest, I don’t know. Nobody knows what the future of web
development holds. Things are moving so rapidly that<br />
there is no way to predict the future. All we can do is absorb as much
information as possible and ride along with<br />
the rest of the community.</p>

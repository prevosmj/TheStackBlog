<h3 id="test-driven-development-tdd">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
<p>Testing is one of, if not the most important part of any development.
I is extremely rare and impressive for someone to<br />
create an entire program or website, compile it, run it, and have every
aspect work on the first try. It just isn’t<br />
realistic. Many times, there are edge cases that fall outside of the
bounds of the program, therefore breaking it.<br />
Test-driven development (TDD) flips this on its head by creating the
tests first, then writing a program around it. In my<br />
opinion, this would only make sense for creating many modules that are
mostly completely seperated. Specifically,<br />
if a program has very specific parameters would be best for this. That
being said, there are many upsides to TDD.<br />
All of the written code is more modular than a standard program might
be. This allows for the developer to more<br />
easily maintain and update the code without breaking multiple modules at
once. TDD also prevents bloat in programs.<br />
The only code that is written is the code needed to pass the tests.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-driven-development-bdd">Behavior-Driven Development
(BDD)</h3>
<p>When working with clients in the real world, behavior-driven
development (BDD) is very important to the success of a<br />
product. Without someone representing the client during the creation
process, the developers and testers are left to<br />
guess what it is the client really wants. I know from experience that
requirements documents can drastically change once<br />
a project gets to the execution phase. Some things can’t be done, some
need changes, and sometimes the customer wants<br />
to change an aspect after the fact, but won’t tell you until delivery
(Thanks Mark). <em>The Fullstack Developer</em> makes a<br />
good point in the section about the “Three Amigos.” It is equally
important to have someone representing the customer<br />
as it is to give everyone an equal voice in the matter. This will lead
to the best design and functionality overall.<br />
If everyone isn’t on the same page during the development process, there
wil be mistakes and time will be wasted.</p>
<h3 id="modern-javascript">Modern JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is one of the most used languages for websites and still
is to this day. JavaScript was mostly used for<br />
front-end development until somewhat recently due to the lack of
modularity and having to “double-implement” functions<br />
for a server and a client. This was helped immensely by NodeJS among
other environments. This allowed modules to be<br />
seperate and not clog up the global namespace. The change from
JavaScript just being a front-end website language to<br />
being a fully fleshed out package manager with modules and transpilers
did not take much time. Many developers still<br />
struggle to keep up since everything changes so quickly. With NodeJS,
React, Vue, Angular, and others, JavaScript is<br />
still a powerhouse of a language.</p>
